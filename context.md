Momentum: Finish What You Start
Project Overview
Momentum is a SaaS application designed to help individuals, particularly creatives, entrepreneurs, and anyone with multiple interests, overcome "Shiny Object Syndrome" â€“ the tendency to start many projects but struggle to finish them due to constant new ideas and distractions.

Instead of being just another generic project manager, Momentum focuses on providing tools and workflows specifically tailored to manage creative energy, prioritize effectively, and build consistent progress towards project completion.

The Problem
Many talented individuals are brimming with ideas. However, this constant influx of new inspiration can lead to:

Starting numerous projects simultaneously.

Abandoning ongoing work when a new, exciting idea emerges.

Feeling scattered, overwhelmed, and unproductive despite being busy.

Difficulty maintaining focus and momentum on a single task or project long enough to see it through.

This results in a graveyard of unfinished projects and a sense of frustration and underachievement.

The Solution: Momentum
Momentum provides a structured environment that acknowledges the value of new ideas while guiding the user to maintain focus on their current commitments. Key principles include:

Idea Management: A safe space to capture ideas without immediately starting them.

Prioritization: Tools to limit simultaneous active work and force conscious choices.

Commitment & Focus: Features to encourage dedicated work periods and visualize progress.

Review & Reflection: Mechanisms to revisit dormant ideas and learn from past patterns.

Key Features (Modules)
The application is being developed module by module, focusing on building a robust solution from the ground up.

Phase 1: Foundation & Core Loop (MVP)
Landing Page: Public-facing website explaining the problem and solution, driving sign-ups.

Authentication: Secure user registration and login system.

Dashboard: The central hub providing an overview of active projects, ideas, and key metrics.

Idea Incubator: A dedicated section to quickly capture, store, and manage new project ideas without creating full projects.

Basic Project View & Creation: Functionality to create new projects and view a list of all projects across different states.

Project States Management: The ability to assign and change project states (e.g., Active, Paused, Idea, Completed, Archived, Graveyard) to reflect their current status in the workflow.

Phase 2: Enhancing Focus & Commitment
Detailed Project View: A dedicated page for each project to manage tasks, notes, and other related information.

Focused Work Timer: Integration of a Pomodoro or custom timer to encourage dedicated work sessions on the active project.

Progress Visualization: Visual indicators (like progress bars) on projects to show completion status based on tasks or milestones.

Active Project Limit Configuration: Allows users to set and enforce a personal limit on the number of projects they can have in the 'Active' state simultaneously.

Commitment Setting: Ability to set a personal commitment period for working on a specific project, visible on the project details.

Phase 3: Review & Refinement
Scheduled Check-ins Setup: Configuration options for setting up automated reminders to revisit projects in 'Paused', 'Archived', or 'Incubating' states.

Check-in Notifications: In-app notifications or prompts when a scheduled check-in is due, presenting the projects for review.

Basic Analytics Dashboard: Simple visual reports showing user activity, such as projects started vs. completed and projects by state.

Project Archiving/Graveyard: Dedicated views and clear distinctions for projects that are unlikely to be completed or are permanently set aside, reducing clutter in main views.

Phase 4: Growth & Advanced Features (Hero)
Advanced Analytics & Insights: Deeper analysis of user patterns, such as time spent in states, project switching frequency, and personalized tips based on data.

Customizable Project Templates: Ability to save project structures (tasks, notes) as templates for faster creation of recurring project types.

Integration Settings: Options to connect with external services like calendars (for deadlines/milestones) or cloud storage (for project files).

Team/Collaboration Features: (Future) Functionality to share projects and collaborate with others, applying the Momentum workflow to team efforts.

Account & Profile Settings: Standard user settings for managing profile information, subscriptions, notifications, and data.
